Learner: Celeste De Santiago 

In this benchmark module, I wrote functions to load a list of contacts, and print them out in the console. A file with some scaffolding was already provided.

Complete the functions provided, such that all the specs are met.
Specs

   - Contacts printed in the console must be sorted by the contact's full name
   - Functions addContact, addContacts and printContacts have been implemented
